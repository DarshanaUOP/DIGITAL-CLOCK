# CLOCK FIRMWARE

### DESCRIPTION
homemade Clock for develope your own clock firmware and your own hardware <br>
following figure is the PCB designed for this Clock
it has ,<br>
* A microprocessor (ATMEGA 328P) - which is running this firmware
* 74HC328 - (High-Speed CMOS Logic 3- to 8-Line Decoder)
* DS1307 - RTC Module
	and a set of Seven segment displays <br>
<img src = "pcb.png" width = "100%" >

I am using this clock as a prototype version for design and implement new fermware, new hardware pluggings and such implementations.
JP3 of this circuit which you can see in above circuit is the connector of the module "DS1307 - RTC module" , if you need to connect your device you can remove it and update hardware.
